Project Description: Multi-Tier Web Application Stack Deployment on AWS
Overview
This project focuses on deploying a multi-tier web application stack (VPROFILE) using AWS cloud infrastructure. The architecture consists of multiple layers, including load balancers, application servers, databases, message brokers, and caching servers to ensure scalability, security, and high availability. The entire deployment process is automated using Bash scripts for infrastructure provisioning and application setup.

ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives
Deploy a multi-tier web application on AWS.
Automate infrastructure setup using Bash scripts.
Implement scalability and high availability using AWS ELB, Auto Scaling Groups, and Route 53.
Secure the deployment with security groups, IAM roles, and SSL certificates.
Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.
Integrate DNS (GoDaddy) with AWS Route 53 for domain mapping.
ðŸ›  Tech Stack & AWS Services Used
Infrastructure: Amazon EC2, Auto Scaling Groups (ASG), AWS Route 53, S3, IAM
Load Balancing & Traffic Management: AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), HTTPS with AWS Certificate Manager
Application Servers: Apache Tomcat (running on EC2)
Database & Caching: MySQL (RDS), Memcached
Messaging System: RabbitMQ
Automation: Bash Scripts for provisioning & deployment
DNS & Domain Management: AWS Route 53, GoDaddy DNS
ðŸ“Œ Flow of Execution
Login to AWS Account - Access AWS console or use CLI.
Create Key Pairs - Generate SSH key pairs for secure access.
Create Security Groups - Define firewall rules for access control.
Launch EC2 Instances with User Data (Bash Scripts) - Automate instance setup.
Update IP to Name Mapping in Route 53 - DNS configuration.
Build Application from Source Code - Compile and package the application.
Upload Artifacts to S3 - Store application binaries securely.
Download Artifacts to Tomcat EC2 Instance - Deploy application on Tomcat.
Setup ELB with HTTPS - Secure traffic with SSL from AWS Certificate Manager.
Map ELB Endpoint to Website Domain (GoDaddy DNS) - Custom domain mapping.
Verify Deployment - Ensure proper application functioning.
Set Up Auto Scaling Group for Tomcat Instances - Scale application dynamically.
ðŸ“‚ Bash Scripts in the Repository
The repository contains Bash scripts that automate the setup of each application component:

Script Name	Purpose
backend.sh	Deploys backend services
memcache.sh	Sets up Memcached caching layer
mysql.sh	Configures MySQL database
nginx.sh	Installs and configures NGINX as a reverse proxy
rabbitmq.sh	Deploys RabbitMQ messaging service
tomcat_ubuntu.sh	Installs and configures Tomcat
ðŸš€ Deployment Automation
Infrastructure Provisioning: Bash scripts create and configure EC2 instances.
Configuration Management: Automates database, caching, and messaging setup.
Deployment Pipeline: Uses S3 for artifact storage and ELB for traffic management.
Auto Scaling: Ensures availability based on traffic demand.
âœ… Expected Outcomes
Fully automated multi-tier deployment using AWS services.
Scalable and secure application infrastructure.
Cost-effective deployment with auto-scaling and efficient resource allocation.
ðŸ“Œ Future Enhancements
Implement Terraform or Ansible for infrastructure as code (IaC).
Integrate CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins/GitHub Actions) for continuous deployment.
Optimize costs using AWS Lambda and serverless architectures.

# Database
Here,we used Mysql DB 
sql dump file:
- /src/main/resources/db_backup.sql
- db_backup.sql file is a mysql dump file.we have to import this dump to mysql db server
- > mysql -u <user_name> -p accounts < db_backup.sql
